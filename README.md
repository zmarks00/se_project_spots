# Project 3: Spots

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!

# Spots

A simple image sharing site optimized for mobile and desktop

## Description

The basis of this project was to create a webpage utilizing my (newly) acquired knowledge of flexbox, grid, and media queries. This project involved HTML and CSS markup to lay out elements in a multitude of ways. I needed the header to be laid out using flexbox and the cards to be laid out using grid. I used media queries in order to change the orientation and appearance of the webpage at a certain dimension in pixels (ie mobile view). This was a fun and challenging project all at once. It tested my abilities as far as using Figma, which was brand new to me, and required me to use the dev tools in google chrome to quickly make changes without fully committing to them first. This project also was the first time I imported downloaded fonts and deployed them to the page. All code is written in accordance with BEM methedology which makes it extremely easy to follow and understand.
